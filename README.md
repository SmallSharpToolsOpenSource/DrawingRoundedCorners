Drawing Rounded Corners
=======================

Examples of drawing various shapes with code

Drawing shapes with code is useful when the shapes require different colors, rounded corners or placement of details in the drawing. These examples show how various shapes can be drawn in code including a quote bubble which works well for callout views with a map.

Another benefit of drawing shapes is image management for various PNG files is not necessary and images are automatically scaled for the device. The latest iPhone screen will automatically render with the right scale without any changes to the code.

Below are examples of shapes drawn with the included sample code.
